Python MP4 converter
====================

This script converts videos in a given folder for use in Flowplayer and other HTML5 video players. It is meant to be accessed from the command line as well.

I use it on my media server, and it was not meant to be redistributed, hence the lack of refinement. However, it works really well and can easily be adapted to your usage pattern.

ffmpeg and libx264 are required for this script to work
